    <h1> Road Not Taken</h1>
  <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
    And sorry I could not travel both
    And be one traveler, long I stood
    And looked &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; down one as far as I could
    <em> where it bent in the undergrowth;
    took the other, as just as fair,
    And having perhaps the better claim,
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear</em>

    Though as for that the passing there
    Had worn them really about the same,
    <br>And both that morning<br>equally lay
    <ul>
        <li>In leaves no step had trodden black. </li>
        <li>I kept the first for another day!</li>
    </ul>
    Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li>I doubted if I should ever come back.</li>
        <li>I shall sigh be telling this with a</li> 
    </ol>
    Somewhere ages and ages hence:
    Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
    <strong>I took the one less traveled by,
    And that has made all the difference.</strong>
